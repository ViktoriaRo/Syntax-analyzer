> Welcome to THE GAME. Over the course of peer review you are going to win and lose points. Here are the rules:
> * You work for Correctness points. The minimum is **0**. The maximum is **50**.
> * In general, you start with **25** points.
> * You will start with **0** points if TA find an obvious mistake in the output.
> * You will not know your start amount until THE GAME is finished.
> * You lose **1** points for every *performance problem* found in your code.
> * You lose **3** points for every *wrong output problem* found in your code.
> * You lose **10** points for every distinct case of *hang or crash*.
> * You gain **1** point for every distinct problem correctly *reported*.
> * You gain **3** points if the problem is *reported and located*.
> * You gain **10** points if the problem is *reported, located and fixed*.
> * The problems are considered distinct if they have different origin.
> * In your team list across **your variant**, you get to review only the team listed directly above and the team directly below. If you are the top one, you get to review the second and the last. If you're the last one, you get to review one before last and the first.
> This implies that you *can't* report on yourself or your teammates.
