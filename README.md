# Syntax-analyzer
Syntax Analyzer for compiler Construction course in Innopolis University
The task is to write Syntax analyzer. The requirements: 
- Teams and what language to parse - see in the attached file 
- The parser should recognize most common structures: 
a) imports 
b) functions (with params, function calls) 
c) cycles 
d) if's 
e) simple expressions (with +-*/() ) 
f) string and number literals 
g) variables, assignments 
h) maybe something else very useful or useful-specific for your language 
- You can use any tool for generating the parser from grammar 
- Put your grammar in BNF in the readme. 
- Input (in.txt) should contain example with most common structures 
- Output (out.txt) should contain json representation (it is like Intermediate Representation) of your input (as in the previous HA - we are waiting for the best format from you, specification here is not mandatory) 
- Requirements for tests, readme, good structure - the same.
